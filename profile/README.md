# Ai West Africa (AiWA)

**From San Diego, California to Busumbala, The Gambia**, AiWA builds ethical AI tools to preserve West African languages, oral traditions, and cultural identity.  

We focus on linguistic equity, economic empowerment, and the responsible use of artificial intelligence in underserved regions.
